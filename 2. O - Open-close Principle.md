# Open-closed Principle

This principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, components etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

There are two primary attributes in the OCP:

* It is **open** for extension — This means you can extend what the module can do.
* It is **closed** for modification — This means you cannot change the source code, even though you can extend the behavior of a module or entity.

## JS class-based Example

For example, suppose you have an array of сars, which contains a list of available cars in our cars store. In the buyCar class, a buy() method will check if a particular car is availble and logs a message.

```
const cars = ['Audi', 'BMV', 'Volkswagen'];

class buyCar {
    constructor(car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    buy() {
        if (cars.indexOf(this.car) > -1) {
            console.log('Great success. You now can buy the car.');
        } else {
            console.log('Epic fail. No car for you.');
        }
    }
}
```

The code above fails the OCP principle. Why? Well, because the code above is not open to an extension, meaning for you to add new car to the list, you would need to directly edit the cars array. This means that the code is no longer closed to modification. 
To fix this, you would need an extra class or entity to handle addition, so you no longer need to modify the code directly to make any extension.

```
class addCar {
    constructor(car) {
        this.car = car;
    }
    add() {
        cars.push(this.car);
    }
}
```

Here, we've added a new class — addCar – to handle addition to the cars array using the add() method. This means your code is closed to modification but open to an extension because you can add new cars without directly affecting the array.

```
const addHyundaiCar = new addCar('Hyundai');
addHyundaiCar.add();
const buyHyundaiCar = new buyCar('Hyundai');
buyHyundaiCar.buy();
```

Also, notice that SRP is in place because you created a new class. 

## Vue 3 Components Example

Let’s suppose that we have CarsList component. 

```
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="cars-list">
      <div v-for="car in cars" :key="car.id" class="car-list__car">
        <span :class="{ 'car-list__car--new': car.year > 2015 }">
          {{ car.model }}
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { Car } from '@/types'

defineProps<{cars: Car[]}>()
</script>
```

We can see that it takes list of cars and create a bunch of cards to represent our cars. However, what will happen if we want to change these cards or even show our cars as a table, not cards? We must change (modify) our component. It looks a bit inflexible now. OCP tells us: **“Components should be open for extension, but closed for modification”**. Let’s fix this violation.

We can use vue slots to make our components/TodoList.vue more flexible.

```
<template functional>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="cars-list">
      <slot />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

And move our cards to a separated component components/CarCard.vue

```
<template>
  <div class="car-list__car">
    <span :class="{ 'car-list__car--new': car.year > 2015 }">
      {{ car.model }}
    </span>
  </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Car } from '@/types'

defineProps<{car: Car}>()
</script>
```

And update views/Home.vue

```
<template>
  <div>
    <Header title="Cars list" />
    <main>
      <CarsList>
         <CarCard v-for="car in cars" :key="car.id" :car="car" />
      </CarsList>
    </main>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { Car } from '@/types'
import { Api } from '@/api'
import Header from '@/components/Header.vue'
import CarsList from '@/components/CarsList.vue'

const cars = ref<Car[]>([])

onMounted(() => {
  cars.value = await fetchCars()
})

async function fetchCars(): Promise<Car[]> {
  const api = new Api('cars')
  return await api.fetch()
}
</script>
```
Now we can easily replace our tasks visualization with another component.

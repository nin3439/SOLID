# Liskov Substitution Principle

In simple terms, the Liskov principle states that we should not replace a parent class with its subclasses if they create unexpected behaviors in the application.

## JS class-based Example

For example, consider a class named Vehicle, which includes a function named go().

```
class Vehicle{
  go() {
    console.log("Vehicle goes")
  }
}
```

Now let's extend the Vehicle class to a new class named Car with a function named refuel().

```
class Car extends Vehicle{
  refuel() {
    console.log("Car can be refueled with petrol or diesel")
  }
}

var nissan = new Car();
nissan.go();
nissan.refuel();
```

In the previous example, we created an object named nissan from the Car class and called both the go() and refuel() methods. Since the nissan is capable of both those actions, extending the Vehicle class to the Car class does not violate the Liskov principle.

Now let’s extend the Car class further and create a new class named ElectroCar.

```
class ElectroCar extends Car{
  console.log("ElectroCar can't be refueled with petrol or diesel")
}

var tesla = new ElectroCar();
tesla.go();
tesla.refuel();
```

This extension of the Car class violates the Liskov principle since ElectroCar cannot be refueled — this could create unexpected behavior in the application. The best way to address this case is to extend the ElectroCar class from the Vehicle class.

```
class ElectroCar extends Vehicle{

  recharge() {
    console.log("Electro Car can be recharged")
  }
}

var tesla = new ElectroCar();
tesla.go();
tesla.recharge();
```

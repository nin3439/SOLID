# Liskov Substitution Principle

In simple terms, the Liskov principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## JS class-based Example

For example, consider a class named Vehicle, which includes a function named go().

```
class Vehicle{
  go() {
    console.log("Vehicle goes")
  }
}
```

Now let's extend the Vehicle class to a new class named Car with a function named refuel().

```
class Car extends Vehicle{
  refuel() {
    console.log("Car can be refueled with petrol or diesel")
  }
}

var nissan = new Car();
nissan.go();
nissan.refuel();
```

In the previous example, we created an object named nissan from the Car class and called both the go() and refuel() methods. Since the nissan is capable of both those actions, extending the Vehicle class to the Car class does not violate the Liskov principle.

Now let’s extend the Car class further and create a new class named ElectroCar.

```
class ElectroCar extends Car{
  console.log("ElectroCar can't be refueled with petrol or diesel")
}

var tesla = new ElectroCar();
tesla.go();
tesla.refuel();
```

This extension of the Car class violates the Liskov principle since ElectroCar cannot be refueled — this could create unexpected behavior in the application. The best way to address this case is to extend the ElectroCar class from the Vehicle class.

```
class ElectroCar extends Vehicle{

  recharge() {
    console.log("Electro Car can be recharged")
  }
}

var tesla = new ElectroCar();
tesla.go();
tesla.recharge();
```

## Vue 3 Components Example

Here is an example of how this principle can be applied to Vue components. In this example, we have a component that displays a form with a submit button (Form.vue):

```
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="submit">
    <slot />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script setup>
function submit() {
  console.log('Form submitted!')
}
</script>
```

Here’s a subclass that extends the base component and adds two text fields:

```
<template>
  <Form>
    <input type="text" v-model="username" />
    <input type="text" v-model="password" />
  </Form>
</template>

<script setup>
const username = ref('')
const password = ref('')
</script>
```

In this subclass, we have added two text fields for the user to enter their username and password. The subclass can be used in place of the base component without affecting the overall functionality of the application. When the form is submitted, the submit method from the base component will still be called, and the message will still be logged to the console.

By following the Liskov Substitution Principle in this way, the development of the UI can become more flexible and scalable, making it easier to maintain and extend the application over time.

Just like the Open/Closed principle, the Liskov substitution principle is also something that is already integrated into the architecture of Vue and we make use of it without knowing what it is actually called.

# Interface Segregation Principle

This principle means: "No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones."

## JS class-based Example

Since JavaScript does not support interfaces, it is difficult to adopt this principle in JavaScript-based applications. However, we can use JavaScript compositions to implement this. Compositions allow developers to add functionalities to a class without inheriting the entire class. For example, assume that there is a class named DrivingTest with two functions named startCarTest and startTruckTest. If we extend the DrivingTest class for CarDrivingTest and TruckDrivingTest, we have to force both classes to implement the startCarTest and startTruckTest functions.

```
Class DrivingTest {
  constructor(userType) {
    this.userType = userType;
  }

  startCarTest() {
    console.log(“This is for Car Drivers”’);
  }

  startTruckTest() {
    console.log(“This is for Truck Drivers”);
  }
}

class CarDrivingTest extends DrivingTest {
  constructor(userType) {
    super(userType);
  }

  startCarTest() {
    return “Car Test Started”;
  }

  startTruckTest() {
    return null;
  }
}

class TruckDrivingTest extends DrivingTest {
  constructor(userType) {
    super(userType);
  }

  startCarTest() {
    return null;
  }

  startTruckTest() {
    return “Truck Test Started”;
  }
}

const carTest = new CarDrivingTest(carDriver );
console.log(carTest.startCarTest());
console.log(carTest.startTruckTest());

const truckTest = new TruckDrivingTest( ruckdriver );
console.log(truckTest.startCarTest());
console.log(truckTest.startTruckTest());
```

However, this implementation violates the interface segregation principle since we are forcing both extended classes to implement both functionalities. We can resolve this by using compositions to attach functionalities for required classes as shown in the following sample.

```
Class DrivingTest {
  constructor(userType) {
    this.userType = userType;
  }
}

class CarDrivingTest extends DrivingTest {
  constructor(userType) {
    super(userType);
  }
}

class TruckDrivingTest extends DrivingTest {
  constructor(userType) {
    super(userType);
  }
}

const carUserTests = {
  startCarTest() {
    return ‘Car Test Started’;
  },
};

const truckUserTests = {
  startTruckTest() {
    return ‘Truck Test Started’;
  },
};

Object.assign(CarDrivingTest.prototype, carUserTests);
Object.assign(TruckDrivingTest.prototype, truckUserTests);

const carTest = new CarDrivingTest(carDriver );
console.log(carTest.startCarTest());
console.log(carTest.startTruckTest()); // Will throw an exception

const truckTest = new TruckDrivingTest( ruckdriver );
console.log(truckTest.startTruckTest());
console.log(truckTest.startCarTest()); // Will throw an exception
```

Now, carTest.startTruckTest(); will throw an exception since the startTruckTest() function is not assigned to the CarDrivingTest class.

## Vue 3 Components Example

Let's create component with car card.

```
<template>
  <div class="car-list__car">
    <span :class="{ 'car-list__car--new': car.year > 2015 }>
      {{ car.model }}
    </span>
  </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
type Car = {
  id: number
  model: string
  color: string
  year: number
  type: string
}

defineProps<{car: Car}>()
</script>
```

As you can notice, we send the whole car object as prop in CarCard.vue, but we are using part of this object only. We don’t use id, type, color propertires. We are violating ISP: “Components shouldn’t be forced to depend on properties and methods they do not use”.

There are capo of ways to fix this issue:

* slice Car interface to few smaller interfaces
* pass only used properties to components

Let’s refactor our code

```
<template>
  <div class="car-list__car">
    <span :class="{ 'car-list__car--new': year > 2015 }>
      {{ model }}
    </span>
  </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">

defineProps<{model: string, year: number}>()
</script>
```

Now it is looking better.

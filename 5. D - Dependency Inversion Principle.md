# Dependency Inversion Principle

**DIP** tells: “High-level classes (components) shouldn’t depend on low-level classes (components). Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn’t depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.”

What is mean high and low level classes.

* Low-level classes implement basic operations such as working with API.
* High-level classes contain complex business logic that directs low-level classes to do something.

Simply put, this principle states that your classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes instead of specific classes and functions. This makes your classes open to expansion, following the open-closed principle.

## JS class-based Example

Let's look at an example. When building a store, you would want your store to make use of a payment gateway like stripe or any other preferred payment method. You might write your code tightly coupled to that API without thinking of the future.

But then what if you discover another payment gateway that offers far better service, let’s say PayPal? Then it becomes a struggle to switch from Stripe to Paypal, which should not be an issue in programming and software design.

```
class Store {
    constructor(user) {
        this.stripe = new Stripe(user);
    }

    purchaseBook(quantity, price) {
        this.stripe.makePayment(price * quantity);
    }

    purchaseCourse(quantity, price) {
        this.stripe.makePayment(price * quantity);
    }
}

class Stripe {
    constructor(user) {
        this.user = user;
    }

    makePayment(amountInDollars) {
        console.log(`${this.user} made payment of ${amountInDollars}`);
    }
}
```

Considering the example above, you'll notice that if you change the payment gateway, you won't just need to add the class – you'll also need to make changes to the Store class. This does not just go against the Dependency Inversion Principle but also against the open-closed principle.

To fix this, you must ensure that your classes depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions. For this example, this interface will contain all the behavior you want your API to have and doesn't depend on anything. It serves as an intermediary between the high-level and low-level modules.

```
class Store {
    constructor(paymentProcessor) {
        this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
    }

    purchaseBook(quantity, price) {
        this.paymentProcessor.pay(quantity * price);
    }

    purchaseCourse(quantity, price) {
        this.paymentProcessor.pay(quantity * price);
    }
}

class StripePaymentProcessor {
    constructor(user) {
        this.stripe = new Stripe(user);
    }

    pay(amountInDollars) {
        this.stripe.makePayment(amountInDollars);
    }
}

class Stripe {
    constructor(user) {
        this.user = user;
    }

    makePayment(amountInDollars) {
        console.log(`${this.user} made payment of ${amountInDollars}`);
    }
}

let store = new Store(new StripePaymentProcessor('John Doe'));
store.purchaseBook(2, 10);
store.purchaseCourse(1, 15);
```

In the code above, you will notice that the StripePaymentProcessor class is an interface between the Store class and the Stripe class. In a situation where you need to make use of PayPal, all you have to do is create a PayPalPaymentProcessor which would work with the PayPal class, and everything will work without affecting the Store class.

```
class Store {
    constructor(paymentProcessor) {
        this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
    }

    purchaseBook(quantity, price) {
        this.paymentProcessor.pay(quantity * price);
    }

    purchaseCourse(quantity, price) {
        this.paymentProcessor.pay(quantity * price);
    }
}

class PayPalPaymentProcessor {
    constructor(user) {
        this.user = user;
        this.paypal = new PayPal();
    }

    pay(amountInDollars) {
        this.paypal.makePayment(this.user, amountInDollars);
    }
}

class PayPal {
    makePayment(user, amountInDollars) {
        console.log(`${user} made payment of ${amountInDollars}`);
    }
}

let store = new Store(new PayPalPaymentProcessor('John Doe'));
store.purchaseBook(2, 10);
store.purchaseCourse(1, 15);
```

You will also notice that this follows the Liskov Substitution Principle because you can replace it with other implementations of the same interface without breaking your application.

## Vue 3 Components Example

To shoe this principle in Vue we can use Adapter Pattern, so instead of creating an interface for your Vue components to implement, you can create an adapter component as an interface of your component.

How it works ? Let’s take a look at a sample, say you have this ThirdPartyVideoPlayer from third party to help embed a video on your page:

```
<template>
  <ThirdPartyYoutubeVideoPlayer
    ref="videoPlayer"
    :video-url="url"
    @videoLoad="handleVideoLoad"
  />
</template>
<script setup>
import ThirdPartyVideoPlayer from 'third-party-video-player';
import { ref } from 'vue'

const url = ref('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234567890abc')
const videoPlayer = ref()

const pause = () => {
  videoPlayer.value.pauseVideo();
}

const  handleVideoLoad = () => {
  // Do something
}
</script>
```

What are the issues ?
* Your component is dependent upon ThirdPartyVideoPlayer on some props and methods (e.g: video-url, pauseVideo), so it’s coupled.
* If you find the ThirdPartyVideoPlayer not meeting your requirements, and you want to replace it with another component, you have to change all the components dependent on this component.

To fix this issues we can create wrapper component called VideoPlayerAdapter:

```
<!-- "VideoPlayerAdapter" Component -->
<template>
  <ThirdPartyVideoPlayer
    ref="videoPlayer"
    :video-url="url"
    @onVideoLoad="handleVideoLoad"
  />
</template>
<script setup>
import ThirdPartyVideoPlayer from 'third-party-video-player';
import { ref } from 'vue'

defineProps<url: string>()
const emit = defineEmits<{ (e: 'load'): void }>()

const videoPlayer = ref()

const pause = () => {
  videoPlayer.value.pauseVideo()
}

const handleVideoLoad = () => {
  emit('load')
}
</script>
```

Then you can use VideoPlayerAdapter this way:

```
<template>
  <!-- Something else -->
  <VideoPlayerAdapter
    $ref="videoPlayer"
    :url="url"
    @load="handleVideoLoad"
  />
  <!-- Something else -->
</template>
<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const url = ref('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1234567890abc')

const pause = () => {
  videoPlayer.value.pause()
}

const handleVideoLoad = () => {
  // do something
}
</script>
```
What were improved ?

* Your components are now loosely-coupled with the third party component ThirdPartyVideoPlayer.
* If you need to use another third part component to help embed video, the only component you need to change is the VideoPlayerAdapter.

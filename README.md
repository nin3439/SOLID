**SOLID** is an acronym created by Michael Feathers and promoted by American software engineer Robert S. «Uncle Bob» Martin in his book «Design Principles and Design Templates». Each letter represents one of the five design principles:

* Single responsibility principle
* Open-close principle

* Interface segregation principle

This principles help to maintain, optimize and extend codebase of the project and avoid bad practices. The main GOAL:

``
